## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed
- Flask installed (you can install it using `pip install Flask`)
- MySQL server and client installed

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-flask-app.git
   cd my-flask-app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```plaintext
my-flask-app/
├── app.py               # Main application file
├── templates/           # HTML templates
│   ├── base.html        # Base template (header, footer, etc.)
│   ├── profile.html     # Example template with dynamic content
│   ├── users.html       # Template for displaying users
├── README.md            # This README file
├── requirements.txt     # List of project dependencies
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the Flask application, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the application will run on `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Routes

The application defines the following routes:

- `/` (Root): Displays a simple "Hello, World!" message.
- `/profile/<username>`: Displays a user profile using the `profile.html` template with a dynamic username.
- `/users`: Fetches user data from a MySQL database and displays it using the `users.html` template.

## Templates

Templates are located in the `templates/` directory and use the Jinja2 templating engine. You can customize these templates to suit your project's needs.

## Database

The application uses a MySQL database to store and retrieve user data. To configure the database connection, modify the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` setting in `app.py`. You can use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like SQLAlchemy to work with the database.
